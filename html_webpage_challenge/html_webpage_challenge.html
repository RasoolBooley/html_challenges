                    Here at ActiveCollab, our marketing team is well aware of the long-term value of investing in proper SEO. By “proper”, we mean as organic as possible. And by “as organic as possible”, we mean guest posting all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Since there’s no way of being truly organic without potentially sacrificing a lot of good rankings, we wanted to seem as organic as possible. And that’s why we agreed that an occasional generic guest post on a lower quality website is perfectly fine, contrary to what you might have read, for example.
            </p>
                    Building brand credibility and brand love, generating more leads, becoming a thought leader in our vertical, and even building links with an occasional guest post - these are just some of the activities that require producing content. Lots and lots of content.

        <!-- explaining the purpose of a section element  -->

                <h2 id="sect">The purpose of a section element.</h2>

                <p>
                    The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content. Each section should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the section element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Examples of sections would be chapters, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis. A Web site’s home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, and contact information.
                </p>
        </section>

            <!-- the purpose of a footer element -->

        <footer>
            <p id="foot">A footer element is usually the last part of an element, not necessarily being at the botton of a page but at the botton of a section.</p>
        </footer>
